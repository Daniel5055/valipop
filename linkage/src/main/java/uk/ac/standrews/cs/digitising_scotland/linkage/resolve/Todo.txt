From Meeting with Oz and Graham 6-3-17

1. Are people being put in more than 1 family?

    A: was yes but hopefully fixed? - need to check with results from running KilmarnockMTreeBirthBirthMatcherGroundTruthChecker

2. Distance between family members

3. Are there families that are asserted to be in 2 families whereas there should be 1?

4. Put those that do not match anywhere into separate families.

    done - altered KilmarnockMTreeBirthBirthMatcherGroundTruthChecker

5. Look at those within distance of N rather than nearest neighbour.

-----

6. Merge the code of KilmarnockMTreeBirthMarriageMatcherGroundTruthChecker and KilmarnockMTreeBirthBirthMatcherGroundTruthChecker

        done.

7. Write new classes to proces the Skye data - like above.
