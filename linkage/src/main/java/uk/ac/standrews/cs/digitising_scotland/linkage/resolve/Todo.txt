From Meeting with Oz and Graham 6-3-17

2. Distance between family members

3. Are there families that are asserted to be in 2 families whereas there should be 1?

4. Put those that do not match anywhere into separate families.

    done - altered KilmarnockMTreeBirthBirthMatcherGroundTruthChecker

5. Look at those within distance of N rather than nearest neighbour.

7. Write new classes to proces the Skye data - like above.

New list A/Graham/Eilidh 17-3-17

1. date format is inconsistent - use 11 for Nov rather than Nov

2. Names and middle names - try just using first names rather than whole (sometimes middle names are missing) - Adam vs. Adam Sawers

3. Use std names from Kilmarnock dataset.

4. Take account of distribution of names (and places etc.)

5. Weight names by frequency:
    common name - high frequency
    uncommon name - low frequency ... so do something like name diatance * frequency / normalisation factor

6. Do not use DOM in match

7. Only use year of marriage +/- 3 years?

8. Do date comparison only and see what works best with Eilidh's families from Kilmarnock data.

9. Put all the data in Storr and use a single store

10. Look at efficiency of for all in stream from Stor

11. I/O problems in Storr - are files being shut properly?
