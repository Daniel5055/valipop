Experiments
a. Radius search
	1. Radius of range search, and its effect on quality (precision, recall, family size)
b. Similarity
	1. Altering the rules of how distance is calculated (regarding missing values)
	2. Using weights when calculating distance
	3. Dates: something more sophisticated then string similarity?
	4. Using thresholds on individual fields. post-match.
c. Controlling family size, The Merge
	1. 



Problems
1. Matching of missing values, distance 0 means we are overly generous
2. Controlling the size of the families (during a merge)





minimise the number of families, such that the diameter of each family < threshold

diameter of each family
	- the max pairwise distance
	- or the average pairwise distance
	- or something else that is perfect

minimise the number of families, such that the number of children in each family < threshold


constraints may also be attribute-based. for example of the form: 
- father's surname < threshold





BFT: it maps from personID (per birth) to a list of pairs of (personIDs x distance)
- distances up to 10




Does solving problem: "minimise the number of families, such that the diameter of each family < threshold" solve the familial grouping problem with high precision and recall?


If yes: we will still need to configure another algorithm (like Al's MTree based clustering one) such that it achieves similar results. Use a heuristic algorithm as a proxy to the complete one.
