Stuff that needs written:

Explanation of features and analysis of feature space
Fraser:
Todo:	Write code to analysis feature space - Tool to build code/feature/count maps has been built.
		Decide on which type of analysis we want to do - compare similarity of test/validation sets in terms of codes and features.
		Write about the results of the analysis
		
Jamie:
Other string similarity metircs
Todo:	Write pipelines to perform the experiments - Mostly complete
		Write up the results
		Write up the algorithms

Anyone:
Section on nGram classifier technique
Todo:	Write pipelines to perform experiements - Mostly complete
		Write about algorithms
		Write about results

Jamie:
Add section to results on unique records
Todo: 	Resvisit old results and calculate measures for unique records
		If we can't get unique results from old records then we need to re run these experiments
		
Graham:
Write up section on cost effectiveness
	Todo: Analysis how many unique records in 30millions
	how long to code those unique records and calculate the cost/benefit 
	

Timeline:	
15th	 - Jamie 	- 1 day best case, 1 week worst case - calculate stats for previous experiments or start repeating experiments
		 - Fraser 	- 2-3 days - finish building framework for feature space analysis and run experiements

20th 	 - Graham 	- 1-2 days -  Write section on cost effectiveness	

21st 	 - Jamie 	- 2 days - Run experiements on string similarity

24th	 - Jamie	- 7 days worst case - Run experiments with ngram pipeline.

Extra idea:
Compare quality of exact match look up with best performing machine learning classifier to highlight variations in human coding.
Easiest fix for valid comparison is keeping all the variables the same.

Paper Plan

Abstract - OK, might need updated with new results

Introduction - Looks OK

Data Set - OK if we only use Lambert data, will need updated if we use NAPP HISCO data too.

Approaches to Classification - updated to new approach. 3 String similarity techniques - Jaccard, Dice and Levenshtein.

Cleaning - OK

Edit Distance Classifier 

Individual Machine Learning Classifiers

Ensemble Approaches 

Feature Selection/Feature Space - Update this and discuss: what are features, size of feature space, space overlap, uniqueness etc

New NGram Loss Function Technique - Only if the results are good

Summary

Evaluation

Sequence of Experiements

Accuracy Measures - give results for just unique records

Results

Discussions - Cost effectivnesss of human coders vs automatic techniques

Conclusions
