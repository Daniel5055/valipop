Springer Paper To do list with importance and time estimates

Primary 

Correctness measures when using only unique records
How much data can be classified using exact match only
Cost Benefit analysis for automatic coding in terms of cost and time.
Time estimations for both human and ml etc
Give figures for micro/macro precision and recall. 
Discuss exact nature of features
Distribution of features across training and test sets, analysis of overlap
Possible visualization of the classification result or the feature space, a frequency table of description terms, etc.
could provide some insight in the nature of this task in terms of feature and cluster separation.

Secondary

Investigate efficacy of more advanced string techniques
Possible analysis of other string based approaches such as overlapping terms, overlapping hgh-entropy terms, bag-of-words Jaccard index, ontology-based graph distance 	of terms of corpus descriptions to terms in HISCO descriptions, etc. etc.
Possible further analysis of best technique, improvements for it in the scope of this problem

Tertiary

Section on what the system looks like now, possible trailer for next paper on mulitple classification
- preview different techniques etc
