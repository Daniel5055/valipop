## Algorithms Information

The record classification software uses machine learning models as well as lookup tables to perform coding to single and multiple codes. 
These algorithms are detailed here.

### Online Logistic Regression

This is our primary machine learning algorithm. It's is built on top of Mahout's Logistic Regression implementation ([see here](https://mahout.apache.org/users/classification/logistic-regression.html)).
