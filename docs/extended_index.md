## Working with _ValiPop_

_ValiPop_ as standard is currently able to create populations in the form of the vital event 
records for Scotland ([NRS](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/guides/birth-death-and-marriage-records/statutory-registers-of-births-deaths-and-marriages)). 
Guidance on how to define other forms of event records can be found [here](guides/other-record-types.md).

Some summary statistics are also packaged with _ValiPop_, details of these and how to use your 
own statistics can be found [here](guides/summary-statistics.md).

Depending on the desired behaviour of _ValiPop_ some special implementations can be found 
[here](guides/implementations.md) and a guide to the _ValiPop_ configuration file can be found [here](guides/config.md).  

For more advanced requirements it is possible to extend the code base to meet your 
needs. Helpful resources for working with _ValiPop_ include an [overview](guides/overview.md) of the simulation, 
[JavaDoc for _ValiPop_](https://quicksilver.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/apidocs/population-model/), 
the [code base](https://github.com/stacs-srg/population-model), and the below publications.
