_ValiPop_ is a micro-simulation model for generating synthetic genealogical populations, taking as input a set of desired
summary statistics. _ValiPop_ also verifies that the desired properties exist in the generated
populations. We present an evaluation of the scalability and robustness of the generation approach and discuss the
opportunities of synthetic data for evaluating linkage algorithms.
