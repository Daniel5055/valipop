# Running Valipop

Valipop can either be run locally with Java or within a Docker container.

## Why Java?

- Valipop is run directly on your machine
- Makes handling the input and result files easier
- But requies you to install the correct versions of Java and R

## Why Docker?

- Valipop is run inside a docker container on your machine
- Only requires any version of Docker (or Podman) to run
- But requires you to configure container access to folders for input and results
