The Research

	Design Consideration and Process of Stucture
		Mostly written - case_studies_written.txt

	Population Queries
		What are provided
		Relating to usecases and needs from such a structure

	Textual Justifications
		How handled
		Ran from which prospective?
			Requirements from underlying linkage - rerun or store at generation

	Query Language
		Abstraction away from the code level
		Iterators?
		Calls?

	The implementation
		Overview of approach
		Detailing of data structure - identifing the overlay of concepsual on real program classes

	Case studies/Evaluation
		Justification of consepual and implementted stucture in light of real case studies
		Consideration of scaling?
