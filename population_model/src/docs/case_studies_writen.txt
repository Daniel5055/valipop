Note on vocabulary // Need to go through and make sure this is consistent throughout
Where the phrase 'paper records' is used this is refering to the records that exist in the pre linked dataset.
Within the specified data structures, 'links' will be seen that go from an itermidiary object in the structure to a person. Due to the complications arrising from such a structure representing the output of an underling linkage process, although the links in the below figures are conseputaly easy to think of as links I will use the term 'edge' akin to its use in graph theory to maintain clarity of meaning.

Aim

The aim of this project was to look at ways of sturctuing and representing linked data sets where uncertainty, by the way of multiple co-existing linkage solutions, has been produced by the linkage project of multiple data sets. The domain of focus is genalogical linkage and created data structures represnts the multiple possible pedigrees that are attested to possibly reside within the linked data sets. Although the initial consideration of the construction of the data structures have been based in loose relation to birth and marriage records, especial care has been taken to remain record agnostic and to build structures that aviod making assumptions regarding the underlying records and are able to express any permissible genalogical structuring.

Approach

The approach to doing this began with an intial specification that had been laid down during previous research work. The next step was to expland on this so to allow the many possible genalogigal and uncertainty permertations to be represented, while also offering a structuring that enables restrictions to be placed within the data sructure.

Start point

The initial interfaces for the data consisted of person and partnership objects. In this initial implementation a person has a number of partnerships of which they are a member and a single partnership of which they are the child. A partnership has a single male and female member and also a list children. The assumptions in the use of this structure are that any children listed are known children of the given parents of which there is only one given set. The restrictions in this structure impose limitations to the expresibility of the scarios that can be modelled using the intial interfaces.

It could be considered that the existing interfaces be used with a new set of assumptions to allow uncertainty to be represented, an approach to such would be to create a partnership object for each possible paring permutation that the linkage algorithm identifies and then to place the children possuibly for each permuted partnship into the list of children, however it can be easily seen that the massive number of partnership objects that this would cause to exist would be difficult to understand and to absract the possible pedigrees from. Also maintaining the current interfaces would mean that there would be nowhere in the structure to indicate the likelihood of one linkage solution over another and the provenance and reasoning behind such.

From the above it can be seen that the interfaces need opening up and modifing to allow more expressibility. The approaches discussed below first focus on creating a set of interfaces which are sufficiently expressive followed by considering ways to apply constraints to these structures to restrict complexity of the created genalogical structures.

Case study

The reason for the adjustments that are required to be made to the interfaces and the design of the created data structures are best seen when case studies reflective of real genalogical possibilitys are considered and how the required expression can be acchieved.

Child, parents case study

Firstly we can consider a single child with a set of possible mothers and fathers. Biological we can be certain of the child having one father and one mother, although they may not reside within the dataset. Therefore for each possible parent there will be an amount of certainty associated with the link. There also will be an amount of consideration to be given to the linkage between each possible permutation of parental parings.

Working from these basic requirements and understandings we can start to define data structures which are compatible.

As can be seen in figure <Tree_a> a family tree depicts the given case study. In a sense this same diagram represents the given structure under the initial interface of a child with a parental partership whihc in turn has a male and female member. If we are then to extend this to suppose that Y represents a set of males {B, C} and X a set of females {D, E, F} the initial structure no longer is able to express this. If we now consider the structure as laid out in figure <Struct_a> we see a structure where A is the child of the partnership alpha from which two fathers are linked and three mothers. This structure allows us to maintain an idea of pairing between parents as well as a concept of parent hood, rahter than a more free form structure as seen in figure <Struct_alt_a> when links exist soley between individuals. The introduction of links into the structures means that information can be attached to these edges that denotes the provenance for the link between the two connected entities. For such reason it may make sense to add a link between the tail of the partnership alpha and the child A, both to allow for information to reside here but also to maintain consistency in the structuring, this will be further discussed in the next section.

Child, parents, sibling (Same parental sets for both siblings)

The next case study considered contains multiple children of a single set of parents as depicted by the family tree in figure <Tree_b>. The initial though here is to add multiple links to the bottom of partnership alpha as seen in figure <Struct_b>. This structuring allows for us to stipulate that the sets of parents of A as found in the previous case study extend to B and by the nature of the structure that which ever parental pairing is taken for A must also be taken for B. However given that we wish not to make assumptions regarding the underlying data availiable to us it is possible that the set of fathers and mothers for A and G will not be the identical given the complexities of linkage processes and thus it is likely that the sets offered will be a subset, superset or intersect of one another. If we extend this into a new case study the issue can be made more clear.

Child, parents, sibling (Same parental sets vary between siblings)

The next case study shown in figure <Struct_c> builds upon the previous structure but introduces the stipulation that A's set of fathers is {B, C} thus intessecting G's set of fathers which are {B, H}. This can be seen in the colourings present in <Struct_c>. However if we now remove the assumption that A and G are full siblings and that they could be half siblings or unrelated we introduce the possibility that the parental partnerships of A and G are not the equal and thus that the current structure is unable to express the desired pedigree. The only time we can make use of this structure is where we can be certain of A and G sharing the same pairing of parents, which we cannot assert without more complete knowledge of our data, which we are not able to assume. Therefore we need to further generalise the use of the structure to allow this expressibility.

If we consider figure <Struct_d> we can see a more generalised way of expressing a possible sibling relationship between A and G with the further addition of a possible mother I to person G to demostrate a latter point. This allows for a wider set of possibilities to be presented in the given structure. This set of possibilities includes the possibility that A and G both have an entirely distinct pair of parents ({A: C, F}, {G: H, I}), that they are half siblings either by a shared mother ({A: C, D}, {G: H, D}) or a shared father ({A: B, F}, {G: B, I}), or that they are full siblings ({A: B, E}, {G: B, E}).

Next if we reinstate the stipulation that A are G are siblings. We cannot return to the structure as seen in figure <Struct_c> due to the need to maintain the additional information pertaining to the possible discrete parent linkages and especially in the light of uncertainty as will be further discussed later.

If we introduce a sibling intermidiary object as can be seen in figure <Struct_e> we can infer that A and G are siblings and from which build a picture with greater certainty of the likely topology of the pedigree.  

An asside note about infering siblings with certainty without definate knowledge of the . This is not something that would be present in the current Digisting Scotland dataset but as stated at the outset the designed structure aims to be general enough to express any logical possibility and thus not be dependant on representing linked data only arrising from a certain specification of 'paper record'. An example of a real 'paper record' from which a certain sibling linkage could be infered could be seen in family census records.

Also the people linked to a sibling object cannot be asserted absolutely and thus multiple perople may emerge from either end of a sibling object, this will be explored with a more complex example in the case study see in figure <FIG>. Before discussing this further though it will be useful to discuss the edges in the graph and the annotations that will be found upon them if the structure is to fufill its requirements.

Uncertainty

Now that we have constructed a structure with a resonable degree of expressibility and started to lay in place approaches to constrain the permutations of such where further logical information is held, it may be worthwhile to discuss the uncertainty within the structure before moving on to considering how the structure scales, both computationally and conseptually.

As can be seen in figure <Struct_e> there are multiple links emenating from the right connection point of the object alpha, these represent three possibly mothers of A, however we know that in reality it is only possible for one of the persons D, E and F to be the mother of A. However given the uncertainty inherant within linkage our structures are not desiring to make a definative affirmative indication of a single link, but instead look to present the a range of links. The usability of the given links netherless will benifit from having a metric of which links are more likely and which are less.

The root of any linkage lies in the 'paper records' of the origonal datasets, therefore from an informed human perspective it is important that these records which give provenance to a linkage are identifiable on each edge. The underlying certainty of a given edge will either need to be provided by the linkage process or for it to be possible to recreate the certainty value from the provided provence records. The use of these values when queries are made is discussed in section <SEC>. The placing of information on edges will require some significant changes to the interfaces which are discussed in section <SEC>.

One to one object enforcment

Another important concept within the defined structure is of one to one object enforcment. It will be important to ensure that the underlying linkage problem will enforce this constraint on the produced set of linkages. This assertion can be made from a set of absolute truths that can are defined by the nature of all 'paper records'. Take for example a birth record there is no more than one for each person detailed in the data set therfore we can enforce that only one person be assigned to a the base of a intermediary partnership object and then the attacments to its mother and father points are the possible sets of parents in relation to the linked child. The enforcement of such allows for a structure which can be addressed from a single person and the uncertainty is ecapsulated in the 'sidewards steps' in the structure. This gives sufficient expressibility in the data structure to express the logical genalogical possibilities and therefore there is no reason to allow the uncertainty in the structure to spread beyound its current place.

// Extend discussion to marraiges and pairwise sibling relationships

Is a pairing given on a marraiage record flattenable upon the birth record giving the same pairing, or at least given a certain amount of certainty - is this LA level or respresentation level?
