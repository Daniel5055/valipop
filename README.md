_ValiPop_ is a micro-simulation model for generating synthetic genealogical populations, 
taking as input a set of desired summary statistics. _ValiPop_ also verifies that the 
desired properties exist in the generated populations. _ValiPop_ is highly scalable and 
customisable, it is able to create populations for a wide range of purposes.  The focus 
of our research is the use of many synthetic genealogical populations to evaluate and 
improve data linkage algorithms.

_ValiPop_'s micro-simulation model is written in Java. The supporting verification analysis 
and statistical code is written in R.
