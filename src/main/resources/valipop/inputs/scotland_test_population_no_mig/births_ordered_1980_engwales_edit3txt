# USING THIS DATA - get the cohort count by age division (in row labels) = cc
# multiply cc by the ASFR for a given order to give the number of children to
# be born from this subset of women.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The values are components of ASFR. The sum of a row gives the ASFR for the
# given age range. The proportion of the ASFR speaks to how the value is
# split up across mothers with different numbers of existing children. This
# spread is simply treatable as a proportion.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This could be described as a REACTIONARY STATISTIC - therefore we can have
# 4+ as a value as we simply apply this rate to any females we see with 4 or
# more children. This data has been adjusted to give a tapered lead in that
# can be met at the first application of the data.
