Therefore we cannot have a 4+ value as we need to apply# a value that is 4 or move to the population, and thus we need to have an# upper bound and therefore must state 4-7.# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------# I've taken the liberty of saying 4+ means 4 and if the distribution is# needed to express 5, 6, etc. children in a maternity, then these need to be# stated explicitly.# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------# These values represent the proportion of maternities producing the given# number of children rather than the proportion of children born to each size# of maternity.LABELS	1	2	3	4DATA0-14	0	0	0	015-49	0.8	0.1	0.08	0.0250+	0	0	0	0
